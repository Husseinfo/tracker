## Overview

A face recognition based attendance system.

Python module providing face recognition functionalities:

- Managing faces photos
- Training models
- Making predictions.

## The recognition module

```__init__.py``` contains the face_cascade object, a common resource used in face detection.

```trainer.py``` is responsible for feeding the dataset to different models for training.
Three models are available: ```LBPH, FisherFace``` and ```EigenFace```.

```recognizer.py``` uses pretrained models to make predictions.

```capture.py``` adds photos to user profile.

## The django web interface

- Login
- Homepage: showing last stats of the system
- Add user: to add new faces
- Capture page: to take faces photos from a local or remote device
- Train page: to train models
- Attendance page: shows attendance records
- A RESTful API interface to send attendance records (from the raspberry pi in the prototype device)

## Environment
